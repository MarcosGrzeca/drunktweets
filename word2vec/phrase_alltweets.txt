 we must build up the self-esteem of workers by encouraging them to see themselves as the most fundamental building block of society.
 i am the revolution, i am the people taking the streets, i am the corporations dissolved, i am property communalized.
 we must show the masses why the so called laws are neither natural nor fair; they are capitalist social control devices.
 i am the revolution, i am the annihilator of false moralities, the destroyer of broken ideals, the builder of the commune.
 we must bring the middle class into the revolutionary ranks by stripping them of all attachment to upper_class psychology.
 i am the revolution, i am the lesson that the counterrevolutionaries are waiting to be taught.
 we must denounce those whose life goal is to join the ranks of the intellectual and cultural elites.
 i am the revolution, i am citizens denouncing the lethargy-inducing effects of religion.
 religious morality must be fought against and condemned on the basis that it psychologically weakens citizens.
 i am the revolution, i am coming, i am alive, i breathe the spirit of humanity, i move rapidly towards the commune.
 the financial system must be infected with a sense of emerging global resistance to the agenda of the corporate henchmen.
 i am the revolution, i am the consciousness of the people burning through the psychological barriers erected by capitalism.
 i absolutely need to go out tonight
 we must persuade the populace to see the wealth of the upper_class as the byproduct of intergenerational thieving.
 i am the revolution, i am the transfer of power from the hands of the pigs to the hands of the people.

 the international upper_class uses imperialism as a pretext to drown its own people in military debts.
 the upper_class uses its mass media instruments to paint a picture of an aloof, overly idealistic, left.
 without revolution, the upper_class will never confess their crimes against the worker which are crimes against humanity.
 i no_longer neglect my body now that ive quit drinking. a healthy physicality is vital to a healthy mind.
 the upper_class media promotes escape because they want the worker to fantasize about escaping his oppression instead of revolting.
 deep rem sleep is necessary to get cellular repair like you need!
 the upper_class wants the people to grow more dependent on corporate fast food; the revolutionary cooks his own food.
 after i put down the bottle i felt the most incredible desire. it was freedom moving back into my very being.
 the upper_class wants to control our ideological parameters, lest someone slip to the realm of revolutionary thinking.
 upper_class members are deeply isolated individuals with very low self-esteem, they need luxury goods to feel superior to others.
 the best way to defeat alcoholism is through the revolutionization of the self.
